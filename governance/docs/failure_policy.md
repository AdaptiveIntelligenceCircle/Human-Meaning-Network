# Failure Policy

HMN assumes failure is inevitable.

## Acceptable failures
- Incomplete understanding
- Delayed response
- Conservative overreaction
- Refusal to act under uncertainty

## Unacceptable failures
- Silent ethical drift
- Concealed harm
- Rationalized coercion
- Blame shifting to automation

## Disclosure

Significant failures must be documented and disclosed.
No failure may be erased retroactively.

Failure acknowledged early is preferable
to success built on denial.
