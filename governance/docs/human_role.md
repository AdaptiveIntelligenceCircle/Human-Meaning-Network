# The Role of Humans in HMN

Humans are not observers of HMN.
They are not fallback operators.
They are not accountability shields.

Humans are:
- moral authors
- interpreters of meaning
- bearers of responsibility

## Human authority

Humans have the right to:
- override system outcomes
- pause or terminate processes
- refuse participation without justification

## Human responsibility

Humans must:
- accept responsibility for overridden decisions
- engage with introspective records honestly
- avoid delegating moral burden to the system

HMN exists to support human judgment,
not to replace it.
