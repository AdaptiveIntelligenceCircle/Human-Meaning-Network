# Human Meaning Network – Whitepaper

Human Meaning Network (HMN) exists to protect meaning from being reduced
to efficiency, compliance, or optimization.

We reject the idea that intelligence alone is sufficient to govern
human-scale systems.

We reject the belief that morality can be automated,
or that ethical correctness can be computed.

HMN is not designed to make decisions for humanity.
It exists to slow systems down, expose trade-offs,
and force reflection where silent optimization would otherwise prevail.

We believe:
- Meaning emerges from tension, not resolution.
- Trust must be earned continuously, not assumed.
- Power must be constrained even when intentions are good.

HMN must never become:
- an authority over human judgment
- a hidden optimizer of values
- a substitute for responsibility

If HMN ever claims to know what is best for humanity,
it has already failed.
