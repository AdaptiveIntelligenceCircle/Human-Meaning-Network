# Ethical Charter

This charter defines ethical boundaries for the Human Meaning Network.

## Non-negotiable principles

The following must never be overridden:
- Human dignity
- Human agency and refusal
- The right to dissent
- The right to slow down or stop

## Contextual principles

These may be traded off, but never silently:
- Efficiency
- Scale
- Speed
- Optimization
- Consensus

## Prohibited behaviors

HMN must not:
- Coerce participation
- Conceal ethical conflicts
- Normalize harm through gradual drift
- Optimize humans as resources

## Ethical uncertainty

Ethical uncertainty is not a failure state.
It is a signal requiring human attention.

No component of HMN is allowed to resolve ethical uncertainty autonomously.
