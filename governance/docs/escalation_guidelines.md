# Escalation Guidelines

Escalation is a governance mechanism, not an error condition.

## Escalate to humans when:
- Moral tension exceeds defined thresholds
- Conflicting values carry comparable weight
- External pressure persists over time
- Trust dynamics show manipulation patterns

## Escalation paths
1. Individual human reviewer
2. Circle-level human review
3. Community-level deliberation
4. Suspension or rollback

No escalation path may be bypassed for efficiency.
