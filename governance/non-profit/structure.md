# Organizational Structure

HMN operates as a non-profit, non-owner-driven entity.

## Structural principles
- No single individual holds absolute authority
- Technical leadership does not imply moral authority
- Roles are functional, not hierarchical

Leadership is temporary.
Stewardship is accountable.
