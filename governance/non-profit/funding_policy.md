# Funding Policy

HMN prioritizes independence over growth.

## Principles
- No funding with decision influence
- No exclusive sponsorships
- No dependency on a single funding source

Funding must never:
- dictate system behavior
- influence governance outcomes
- override ethical commitments

If funding compromises integrity,
funding must be refused.
