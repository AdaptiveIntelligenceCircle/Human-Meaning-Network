# Transparency Policy

Transparency is a duty, not a marketing strategy.

## Publicly available
- Governance documents
- Ethical commitments
- Non-sensitive failures

## Restricted
- Personal data
- Sensitive security details
- Information that increases harm risk

Opacity must always be justified.
Silence must never be convenient.
