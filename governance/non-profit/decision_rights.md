# Decision Rights

## Individual authority
- Technical implementation within scope
- Local experimentation with clear rollback

## Collective authority
- Value definitions
- Governance changes
- Escalation thresholds

## Forbidden decisions
No individual or group may:
- redefine ethical boundaries unilaterally
- suppress dissent
- override human refusal

Some decisions must remain undecidable.
