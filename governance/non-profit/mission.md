# Mission

The mission of the Human Meaning Network is to preserve
human meaning, agency, and ethical reflection
in adaptive and intelligent systems.

HMN does not exist to dominate markets,
govern populations,
or replace human institutions.

Its role is to constrain power,
expose moral trade-offs,
and ensure humans remain responsible actors.
