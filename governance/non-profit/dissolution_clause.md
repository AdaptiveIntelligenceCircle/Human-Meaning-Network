# Dissolution Clause

HMN acknowledges the possibility that its continued existence
may become harmful.

## Conditions for dissolution
- Irreversible ethical drift
- Structural capture by external interests
- Loss of human oversight

## Upon dissolution
- Systems are decommissioned
- Data is archived or destroyed responsibly
- No successor inherits authority automatically

A system that cannot end itself
cannot claim ethical legitimacy.
