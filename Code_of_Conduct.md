# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to building a community that values human dignity, intellectual honesty, and long-term responsibility.

This project exists to explore and construct systems related to human meaning, intelligence, and civilization-scale infrastructure.  
As such, ethical conduct is not optional — it is foundational.

We pledge to foster an environment that is:
- Respectful of diverse perspectives and lived experiences
- Grounded in reasoned discourse rather than ideological coercion
- Resistant to harassment, manipulation, or abuse of power
- Oriented toward long-term human well-being

## Expected Behavior

Participants are expected to:
- Engage in discussions with intellectual humility
- Critique ideas, not individuals
- Be transparent about assumptions, limitations, and intent
- Respect boundaries, consent, and psychological safety
- Accept responsibility for the consequences of their contributions

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not tolerated:
- Harassment, threats, or intimidation
- Dehumanizing language or exclusionary practices
- Manipulative rhetoric, gaslighting, or coercive persuasion
- Attempts to weaponize the project for political, ideological, or personal gain
- Exploitation of contributors or users for profit, influence, or control

---

## Enforcement

Project maintainers reserve the right to:
- Remove content that violates this Code
- Restrict or revoke participation when necessary
- Act decisively to protect the integrity of the project and its community

All enforcement decisions will prioritize human safety, project integrity, and ethical responsibility.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:
- All project spaces (repositories, discussions, documentation)

## Final Note

This is not a neutral project.
It is a human-centered one.

Participation implies acceptance of responsibility — not only for code, but for meaning.
