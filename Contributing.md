# Contributing Guide

Thank you for considering contributing to this project.

This project explores complex systems related to human meaning, adaptive intelligence, and long-term civilization design. Contributions are welcomed — but they must meet a high bar of responsibility and clarity.

---

## Who Should Contribute

We welcome contributors who:
- Value long-term thinking over short-term optimization
- Are comfortable working with uncertainty and ambiguity
- Can distinguish between personal belief and shared infrastructure
- Are willing to engage with ethical constraints seriously

You do not need to agree with every idea — but you must respect the project’s intent.

---

## Types of Contributions

We accept:
- Code (core systems, tooling, simulations)
- Documentation and conceptual clarification
- Design proposals and architecture discussions
- Critical feedback and ethical review
- Experiments, datasets, and evaluation frameworks

We do NOT accept:
- Ideological propaganda
- Growth-hacking or engagement manipulation
- Features that prioritize control, surveillance, or persuasion
- Contributions that obscure intent or accountability

## Contribution Principles

All contributions should:
- Be explicit about assumptions and trade-offs
- Favor transparency over cleverness
- Prefer reversibility over irreversible design
- Avoid locking future users into fixed meanings or values

If your contribution reduces human agency, it likely does not belong here.

## Process

1. Open an issue describing the motivation and intent
2. Discuss ethical and architectural implications
3. Submit a pull request with clear documentation
4. Be open to critique, revision, or rejection

Rejection is not a judgment of your worth — it is a safeguard.

## A Note on Ownership

No contributor owns “human meaning”.
This project exists to support human self-interpretation, not to define it.

Thank you for contributing responsibly.
