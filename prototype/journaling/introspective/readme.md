# Introspective Journaling (HMN)

This module implements the introspective layer of the Human Meaning Network (HMN).

Unlike conventional logs or telemetry, introspective journals record:
- value trade-offs
- internal tension
- external pressure
- moral uncertainty

This layer exists to prevent silent ethical drift, collective bias,
and manipulative convergence.

## Core Principles

1. No raw chain-of-thought storage
2. Reflection is descriptive, not prescriptive
3. Moral weight is contextual, not absolute
4. Humans remain the final interpreters

## Scope

- Individual agent reflection
- Circle-level moral dynamics
- System-level pressure awareness

## Non-goals

- Real-time decision override
- Centralized moral authority
- Optimization for speed or scale

This module is intentionally slow, deliberate, and inspectable.
