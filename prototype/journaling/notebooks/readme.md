# Introspective Notebooks – Human Meaning Network

This folder contains human-facing analytical notebooks.

These notebooks are NOT:
- training pipelines
- monitoring dashboards
- performance analytics

They are:
- reflective lenses
- ethical mirrors
- dialogue spaces between humans and adaptive systems

Each notebook focuses on a different layer of meaning:
- individual agents
- small groups (circles)
- trust dynamics
- long-term ethical drift
- planetary-scale pressure

Use them slowly. Re-read them.
Meaning does not reveal itself in one pass.
