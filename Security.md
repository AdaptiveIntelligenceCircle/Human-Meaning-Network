# Security Policy

## Security Philosophy

Security in this project is not limited to technical vulnerabilities.
It includes:
- Psychological safety
- Resistance to manipulation
- Protection against misuse at scale
- Defense against value capture and coercive design

A system that is technically secure but ethically exploitable is not secure.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover:
- Technical vulnerabilities
- Data leakage or privacy risks
- Mechanisms that could enable manipulation or coercion
- Design flaws that reduce human agency or autonomy

Please report them responsibly.

Contact:
- Open a private security issue (if available)
- Or contact the maintainers directly (preferred)

Do NOT disclose vulnerabilities publicly without coordination.

## Scope of Security Concerns

Security issues include, but are not limited to:
- Code-level exploits
- Abuse of APIs or interfaces
- Emergent behaviors that enable control or persuasion
- Incentive structures that reward harmful outcomes
- Integration paths that enable surveillance or misuse

---

## Responsible Disclosure

We aim to:
- Acknowledge reports promptly
- Assess risk holistically (technical + human impact)
- Mitigate issues transparently
- Credit reporters when appropriate

Security is a shared responsibility.

## Final Statement

This project operates under the assumption that
any system capable of shaping meaning can be misused.

Security is therefore not a feature.
It is a permanent obligation.
