# HMN P2P Layer

This is not a generic peer-to-peer network.

HMN P2P exists to:
- protect human-scale groups
- prevent algorithmic amplification
- allow refusal, silence, and withdrawal

## Design Principles

- No broadcast
- No global reputation
- No anonymous virality
- Trust is local
- Circles are finite

## What this layer does NOT do

- No growth optimization
- No engagement scoring
- No network crawling
- No incentive signaling

HMN P2P is intentionally slow.

Slowness is a feature.
