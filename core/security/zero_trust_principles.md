# Zero Trust Principles – HMN

1. No actor is trusted by default
   - Not users
   - Not agents
   - Not maintainers
   - Not founders

2. No irreversible action without explainability

3. No authority without contestability

4. No data access without explicit consent

5. No optimization that reduces human agency

6. HMN may refuse to operate if constraints are violated
