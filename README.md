## Definition

HMN is a decentralized, non-profit network based on AIN – designed to help people discover, share, and maintain their personal meaning in a post-scarcity context (a society where material scarcity is eliminated due to AI automation).

The HMN prototype should begin with a core idea: This is not a dopamine-selling social network (like Facebook), nor a data-selling psychology app (like Calm/Headspace), but a decentralized, non-profit absolute network that helps people reflect on themselves and rediscover the meaning of existence in a post-scarcity context (when AIN succeeds, people are freed from labor/desire and competition, but easily fall into the absurd Camus: "What is the purpose of life?").

## Why we need HMN?
When AIN achieves great success (automating 80-90% of labor, reducing desire for competition), people will face the absurd Camus crisis: 
> "What am I living for when everything else is already taken care of?"

HMN doesn't "create" purpose (it can't be forced), but rather creates a space for people to discover their own purpose authentically, without being manipulated by algorithms or commercial interests.

## Comparision to current systems.
- Not a social network (no likes, no followers, no dopamine loop).

- Not a psychology app (no data sales, no advertising "find meaning in 7 days").

- Not a fixed religion/philosophy (no forced beliefs).

- It's a **network of shared reflection** – combining AI introspective with real human connection.

## Impact (Tentitive) 

- **Individual**: Reduces existential depression by 50–70% (prediction based on 2025 AI mental health research).

- **Society**: Reduces conflict caused by "loss of purpose" – people find meaning in creativity, love, and philosophy instead of competition.

- **Civilization**: An evolutionary step – from “living to survive” → “living for wisdom”.

- **Risk**: If corrupted (with added gamification, “meaning-finding” ads), HMN could become the “new social media” – addicted to meaning instead of likes. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain absolute non-profit and introspectiveness.

## Why is this timing important?

- The ideal timing: AIC/AIN is already stable (22 repos, 2800 files, kernel ethics is sound) – this is the time for HMN to "inherit" and perfect the loop: Technology (AIC/AIN) → Meaning (HMN).

- Potential: The HMN prototype will transform AIC/AIN from "technology" into "civilization" – helping people not only use AI, but live meaningful lives with AI. This is the step to invite other quality followers to join meaning circles private.

- Risk of not doing it immediately: The AIC/AIN grinding process can get stuck at the "technical" level – HMN is the "human" part to balance it out and prevent burnout.
