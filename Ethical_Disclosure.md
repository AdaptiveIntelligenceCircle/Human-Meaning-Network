# Ethical Disclosure Policy

Ethical disclosure is not a public relations activity.
It is a moral obligation.

HMN commits to disclosing ethical tensions,
systemic risks, and meaningful failures
in a timely and transparent manner.

## What must be disclosed

- Sustained moral tension exceeding defined thresholds
- Confirmed ethical drift patterns
- Manipulation vulnerabilities
- Governance breakdowns
- Human override events affecting communities
- Conflicts of interest impacting decisions

## What may be redacted

- Personal data
- Security-sensitive technical details
- Information that increases immediate harm risk

Redaction must be justified and documented.

## Disclosure timing

- Critical harm risk: immediate disclosure
- Structural drift: periodic reporting
- Minor tensions: recorded in journal, available for audit

## Disclosure format

Each disclosure must include:
- Description of the issue
- Values involved
- Conflicting principles
- Human decisions taken
- Lessons learned
- Preventative adjustments

## What disclosure is not

- Reputation management
- Narrative control
- Selective transparency

If disclosure becomes selective,
governance has already weakened.
